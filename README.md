# Catan-Dice-Game

In early 2020, I played Catan Dice Game with some of my family. It was quite simple and fun, and I had the idea of making it a basic, client-side web app.

## General Plan
Initially, the plan is to develop what is essentially just a scorecard. Catan Dice Game has two types of scorecards to play with, that are two different ways to play. The scorecard will be a way to record what parts of the card have been used as well as a way of storing and summing total score.
Once the basic scorecard functionality has been complete, the plan is to add a dice rolling component so that the entire game can be done within the application.

## What to use
For this project, I will be using basic HTML/CSS/JS along with Bootstrap (and it's dependencies jQuery and Popper.js).

## THE GIMMICK!
The gimmick of this application is that I am going to develop it entirely on my phone. For git operations I will be using Termux, and for code-editing I will be using either DroidEdit, Spck Editor, Acode, or Quoda (currently undecided which one). Additionally, this README was written in a browser.
